Welcome to indoctrinate's documentation!
========================================

Installation
------------

Use pip_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install indoctrinate

You might also want to consider using a virtualenv_.

.. note::
   I wouldn't recommend actually installing this, since it doesn't really do
   anything!
